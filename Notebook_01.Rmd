# R Notebook primer

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r cars}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

# Classroom sample data

Let us create random data to fill a MySQL database that describes the following
situation:

* 26 students
    + unique identifier
    + last name
    + first name
    + age
    + gender
* 5 classes
    + unique identifier
    + subject
* Students can register to any number of classes.
* Classes accept any number of students.

This database may then be used to query information such as:

* List of students registered for a class
* Mean age of students registered for a class
* Gender distribution of students registered for a class

# Data generation

## Student identifiers

Let us create 26 simple student identifiers made up of the letter `"S"` and
a two-digit number from `01` to `26`:

```{r studentID}
studentID <- paste0(sprintf("S%.2i", 1:26))
```

## Student name

Let us create 26 simple student names made up of the uppercase and lowercase
letters of the alphabet, such as the first student is called `A` `a`, and the
last student is called `Z` `z`:

```{r studentName}
studentLastName <- LETTERS
studentFirstName <- letters
```

## Student age

Let us select 26 ages randomly sampled from integers in the range [`20`-`25`]:

```{r studentAge}
studentAge <- sample(20:25, 26, TRUE)
```

## Student gender

Let us select 26 random genders randomly sampled between
`"male"` and `"female"`:

```{r studentGender}
studentGender <- sample(c("male", "female"), 26, TRUE)
```

## Class subjects

Let us create 5 simple class identifiers made up of the letter `"C"` and
a single-digit number from `1` to `5`:

```{r classID}
classID <- paste0(sprintf("C%i", 1:5))
```

## Class subject

Let us create 5 simple class subjects made up of 5 consecutive letters from
the alphabet, such as the first two subjects are `"abcde"` and `"fghij"`:

```{r classSubject}
classSubject <-
    sapply(seq(1, 21, 5), function(x){paste0(letters[x:(x+4)], collapse = "")})
```

## Student-class registration

Let us randomly register students to classes.
To do so, we first create all `r 26*5` (= 26 x 5) possible student-class pairs;
we then randomly assign a TRUE/FALSE value to each pair,
where `TRUE` declares that the student is registered to the class:

```{r student_class}
registerStudent <- rep(studentID, times = length(classID))
registerClass <- rep(classID, each = length(studentID))
registerLogical <- sample(c(TRUE,FALSE), length(registerStudent), TRUE)
```

# Export data to text files

## Students

Let us collate student information in a `data.frame` saved in a tabulated file
that will be use to populate a table in the database:

```{r student}
student <- data.frame(
    id = studentID,
    lastname = studentLastName,
    firstname = studentFirstName,
    age = studentAge,
    gender = studentGender
)
write.table(
    student, "student.txt",
    quote = FALSE, sep = "\t", row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
```

## Classes

Let us collate class information in a `data.frame` saved in a tabulated file
that will be use to populate a table in the database:

```{r class}
class <- data.frame(
    id = classID,
    subject = classSubject
)
write.table(
    class, "class.txt",
    quote = FALSE, sep = "\t", row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE
)
```

## Registration

Let us collate registrations in a `data.frame` saved in a tabulated file
that will be use to populate a table in the database:

```{r register}
register <- data.frame(
    student = registerStudent[registerLogical],
    class = registerClass[registerLogical]
)
write.table(
    register, "register.txt",
    quote = FALSE, sep = "\t", row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE
)
```
